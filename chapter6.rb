# Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with  HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!,
# unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
#  To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.
#  (This part is optional, and would be much easier if you read the section on Ruby's random number generator at the end of the methods chapter.)
#  You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.
